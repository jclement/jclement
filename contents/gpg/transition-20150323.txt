OpenPGP Key Transition Statement for Jeff Clement

I have created a new OpenPGP key and will be transitioning away from
my old key.  The old key has not been compromised and will continue to
be valid for some time, but I prefer all future correspondence to be
encrypted to the new key, and will be making signatures with the new
key going forward.

I would like this new key to be re-integrated into the web of trust.
This message is signed by both keys to certify the transition.  My new
and old keys are signed by each other.  If you have signed my old key,
I would appreciate signatures on my new key as well, provided that
your signing policy permits that without re-authenticating me.

The old key, which I am transitioning away from, is:

pub   4096R/0x44EAFEE7C51B2CA8 2014-10-07
      Key fingerprint = 382A B517 8749 3ACD 7DFA  CD6F 44EA FEE7 C51B 2CA8

The new key, to which I am transitioning, is:

pub   4096R/0x4378F71AB4EA336E 2015-03-20
      Key fingerprint = 6B42 6A57 875A E6A7 C910  EF91 4378 F71A B4EA 336E

The entire key may be downloaded from: https://jclement.ca/key.txt

To fetch the full new key from a public key server using GnuPG, run:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 0x4378F71AB4EA336E

If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new key is
signed by the old one:

  gpg --check-sigs 0x4378F71AB4EA336E

If you are satisfied that you've got the right key, and the User IDs
match what you expect, I would appreciate it if you would sign my key:

  gpg --sign-key 0x4378F71AB4EA336E

You can upload your signatures to a public keyserver directly:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --send-key 0x4378F71AB4EA336E

If you'd like any further verification or have any questions about the
transition please contact me directly.

To verify the integrity of this statement:

  wget -q -O- https://jclement.ca/transition-20150323.txt|gpg --verify

- - Jeff
