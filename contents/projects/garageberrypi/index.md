I've just finished up the 2nd versions (1st was in Python) of my GarageberryPi garage door controller / monitoring package.  It's written in Angular/Node.

[View Project on Github](https://github.com/jclement/garageberrypi)

<blockquote>

<p>A RaspberryPi based project to control a garage door and notify one or more phones (via Pushover) if the door is left open for any length of time.</p>

<p>It was written for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li> Avoid those trips back to the house when we're 5 minutes away and can't remember if the door was closed</li>
<li> Avoid those times when I come home from work and the door is open and nobody can remember how long its been like that</li>
<li> We only have one working garage door opener which is always in the other car</li>
</ul>

<p>It has a very simple UI written in Angular + Bootstrap (yes, my garage is a disaster).</p>
