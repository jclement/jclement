I think that using the Yubikey for authentication is worthwhile. OpenBSD's
current implementation of `login_yubikey.c`, however, relies entirely on
the one-time password.  I think the system would be stronger combining
the Yubikey with an additional PIN so that a compromise of the physical
security of the token doesn't compromise the associated account.

My work is loosely based off of [Remi Locherer's suggested patch][patch].  Where it differs is that I'd like to add an optional additional
PIN to the authentication rather than use an existing credential, such
as the system password.  My thinking is, if you are using the Yubikey
token already, the PIN probably can be a fairly low strength password. 
The system password shouldn't be set to something simple.  This allows
for relaxed rules the the Yubikey PIN without affecting the system
password policy as a whole.

I propose adding a new `/var/db/yubikey/$user.pin` file that contains an
encrypted additional PIN (password).  If present, this PIN must precede
the Yubikey one-time password when authenticating.  

The password in `$user.pin` is encrypted in a manner similar to those in
`/etc/master.passwd`.  Obviously, in a multi-user system some tool would
need to be devised to maintain these PIN/passwords.  For my purposes,
the following works

```
# encrypt > /var/db/yubi/$user.pin
password_goes_here
```

This has a couple nice side-effects:

1. By verifying hashed passwords I believe it is less susceptible to
timing attacks and doesn't need a fancy time invariant string compare function
2. Physical compromise of the Yubikey token does not immediately yield
access to the associated account
3. Compromise (read) of the contents of `/var/db/yubikey` does not
immediately allow an attacker to access those accounts

This change is non-breaking in that, if the `$user.pin` file is not
present, login_yubikey works as before.
